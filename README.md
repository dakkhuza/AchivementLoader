# Riks of Rain 2 Achievement Loader

A loader of sorts of the achievement variety

### Installing

Download the .dll from either [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/) or from the [Releases](https://github.com/dakkhuza/AchivementLoader/releases) page and place it into your Bepinex plugins folder.

You'll know it's working if you see this in the output console

### How to make a Custom Challenge
To make a custom challenge just follow these simple steps.

1. Add a class to your plugin that inherits from BaseAchievement
1. Decorate your class with the \[RegisterAchievement\] attribute
1. Override OnInstall and OnUninstall with whatever you need to check for your challenge
1. Call Grant() when the criteria is met
1. (Optionable) If you don't do these, the challenge will still work but text related to it will be broken and it won't unlock anything when completed
   1. Decorate your achievement class with a \[CustomUnlockable\] attribute
   1. Add tokens to the language file for your challenge in the format ACHIEVEMENT_NAMEINCAPS_NAME and ACHIEVEMENT_NAMEINCAPS_DESCRIPTION
   * The [AssetPlus](https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2API/wiki/AssetPlus) api makes this easy
   
Here's an example of what a valid achievement class looks like
```C#
  [CustomUnlockable("Example.Example", "ACHIEVEMENT_EXAMPLEACHIEVEMENT_DESCRIPTION")]
  [RegisterAchievement("ExampleAchievement", "Example.Example", null, null)]
  public class ExampleAchievement : BaseAchievement
  {
      public override void OnInstall()
      {
          base.OnInstall();
          RoR2Application.onUpdate += AutoGrant;
      }

      public override void OnUninstall()
      {
          base.OnUninstall();
          RoR2Application.onUpdate -= AutoGrant;
      }

      public void AutoGrant()
      {
          Grant();
      }
  }
```
